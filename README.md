## Experiment Set-up

## Structure
This project is devided into 3 parts.

* Generator. This part generates random trajectories of particles and calculate the hitpoints on sensors.
* Test. This part takes the results from Main and compares them with the accurate trajectory parameters from Generator.
* Main. This part takes the hitpoints and reconstructs the trajectory parameters.
