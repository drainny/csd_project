# csd_project

Basic:
finish the rest of codes and create new branch (Tong)
write test branch (XH)
decide who is doing the mid present
make slide and practice to present together 
slide:
(git: branch
agile methods: in slide
test: pytest in the code, unitest and doctest in slide
integration: in slide)

Additional:
add Gaussian distribution to generator (Tong)

## Experiment Set-up

## Structure
This project is devided into 3 parts.

* Generator. This part generates random trajectories of particles and calculate the hitpoints on sensors.
* Test. This part takes the results from Main and compares them with the accurate trajectory parameters from Generator.
* Main. This part takes the hitpoints and reconstructs the trajectory parameters.
