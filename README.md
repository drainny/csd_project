# csd_project

Basic:  
<s>finish the rest of codes and create new branch (Tong)</s>  
write test branch (XH)  
decide who is doing the mid present  
make slide and practice to present together   
slide:  
(git: branch(Tong, XH)  
agile methods: in slide(Tong)  
test: pytest in code, unitest and doctest in slide(XH)  
integration: in slide(Hakan, final))  

Additional:  
add Gaussian distribution to generator (Tong)  

<s>next meeting: 2-3pm Wed  
Finish all codes part  </s> 

next next meeting: Friday afternoon  
Finish slide

## Experiment Set-up

## Structure
This project is devided into 3 parts.

* Generator. This part generates random trajectories of particles and calculate the hitpoints on sensors.
* Test. This part takes the results from Main and compares them with the accurate trajectory parameters from Generator.
* Main. This part takes the hitpoints and reconstructs the trajectory parameters.
